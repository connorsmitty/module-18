# Module-18

## User Story 
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list

## Personal Experience
For this assignment we were tasked with creating an API for a social media platform. For this assignment I have been unsuccessful trying to implement the various functions as well as getting the localhost up and running to check bugs and functions on insomnia and mongoose. 

## Tools used
To help me structure and add content to the files I used Blackbox to help answer an questions I may have had as well as looked back at previous assignments and modules to help gather different content and information to get somewhat of a start for this application.
